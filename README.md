# ASR-with-Diarization
in this project I show you how to create and use a simple language model with your wav2vec2 ASR model and combine it with a diarization model.
at first you need to check out the kenlm.ipynb and create your language model. however you also need a text based dataset to do that for your own language.
after that you can use the ASR_implementation_with_lm to test out your ASR alongside pyannote's diarization model.
if you need tips for finetuning a wav2vec2 model, you can contact me through my email at: ehsan77e@gmail.com
